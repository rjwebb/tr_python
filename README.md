# tr_python
The code for my master's project (Implementing a teleo-reactive programming system) at Imperial College London, 2015.

This code is shared under GPL v2, see LICENCE.md

To run the program, you need to have Pedro installed (I used version 1.8): http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/pjr/HomePages/PedroHome.html

The documentation for this system is still a work in progress. In the meantime, refer to the thesis itself: http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04315
